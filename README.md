# Intelligent Transportation System Ring Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the behavior of vehicles on a ring road, focusing on the interaction between human-driven vehicles and vehicles equipped with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). The simulation includes scenarios where ACC-equipped vehicles might be subjected to disruptions or attacks, providing insights into the robustness and dynamics of automated driving systems in mixed traffic conditions.

## Features
- Simulation of a ring road environment with multiple vehicles.
- Customizable parameters for different vehicle behaviors including human drivers and ACC-equipped vehicles.
- Simulation of ACC behavior under normal and attack scenarios.
- Analysis of vehicle spacing, velocity, and acceleration over time.
